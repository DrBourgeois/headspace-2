          Today I found myself staring at the reflection of my screen on a café window.  
          It was both inside and outside, a doubled presence—like the way art lives in my head 
          before it ever takes form. I thought: maybe websites are the same. A window, 
          a repetition, a place where nothing and everything gathers.

          I’m building this small corner of the internet as a sketchbook,  
          a vessel for unfinished thoughts, images I don’t know how to frame,  
          and sounds that dissolve into silence once played.
        </p>
