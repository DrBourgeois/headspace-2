      This work emerges from my ongoing exploration of sound, subjectivity, and relationality. 
      Rooted in both artistic practice and critical inquiry, it approaches listening as a way of thinking through 
      complexity, where differences, tensions, and resonances become sites of meaning-making.

    <p class="mb-6">
      In the quest of deconstructing the hierarchical characteristic of dualisms, 
      understanding how differences are produced and how they matter in materializing relations within phenomena; 
      this podcast, a tripartite speculative sonic landscape, branches out from the ongoing research/project 
      »Oscillating Dialogues«. 
      The piece unfolds as a journey that explores how subjectivities, forces, or becomings come to find form through differential speeds, 
      in harmony or dissonance, marking its beginning as the »chaos« in a mythical sense, and proceeding into the »fold«, 
      expanding the topological nature of subjectivity.

      MODULATIONS ON THE FLY is a series of resonances in sound, art, and philosophy. 
      Students of Petra Klusmeyer’s 
      »Research-Creation, Art Writing, and the Making of Podcasts« of 
      HfK Bremen explore the sonic in its material and conceptual dimension. 
      The podcasts will show you how.
