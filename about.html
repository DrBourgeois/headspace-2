    <p class="mb-6">
      I am drawn to the liminal; the spaces, moments, and identities that exist between definitions.
      My work explores the fluid, the fragmented, and the cyclical, inviting a reconsideration of time, space, and existence. 
      I am fascinated by the interplay of presence and absence, by rhythms that defy structure, 
      and by the quiet tension between movement and stillness.
      I seek to create worlds where linearity unravels, where time becomes a tangled thread, a pause, or a possibility. 
      Rooted in exploration and experimentation, my practice resists rigid frameworks, instead embracing multiplicity and openness.
